## Blueprint for the Low-Latency Trade Engine

This blueprint provides a high-level design (HLD) for the trade engine component of your Opinion Trading Platform—a multithreaded, high-performance system built in C++ to handle real-time order matching for opinion-based trades (e.g., yes/no shares on events). The engine emphasizes ultra-low latency (<10ms per trade), high throughput (1,000+ trades/sec), and scalability, leveraging Boost ASIO for socket programming, multithreading for concurrency, and NUMA awareness for efficient multi-core processing. It integrates with your Java Spring Boot backend via low-latency IPC (e.g., Unix sockets or shared memory) and focuses on an MVP scope for a one-month build: core matching, real-time syncing, and basic "chaos mode" for simulated volatility.

The design assumes deployment on a multi-core server (e.g., AWS EC2 with NUMA support), processing coin-based trades without real-money implications. Key goals include FIFO price-time priority matching, fault tolerance, and minimal jitter.

## System Overview

- **Purpose**: Process incoming orders (buy/sell yes/no shares), match them against an order book, execute trades, and broadcast updates in real-time. Handle high-frequency loads with sub-millisecond execution while supporting chaos injections (e.g., AI-driven price spikes).
- **Key Requirements**:
    - Functional: Order addition/modification/cancellation, matching, event resolution, and logging.
    - Non-Functional: Latency <10ms (end-to-end), throughput >1,000 trades/sec, NUMA-optimized for 4+ cores, graceful degradation on failures.
- **Assumptions**: Orders arrive via sockets from the Java backend; events are predefined (e.g., via config). Use C++17+ with Boost libraries. Test with simulated loads (e.g., 10,000 orders/sec).

## High-Level Architecture

The engine follows a data-oriented, event-driven architecture with a central order book, multithreaded workers, and asynchronous I/O. It runs as a standalone service, listening on sockets for commands and pushing updates via pub/sub.

[Real-Time Clients] <-- [WebSockets Broadcast (Boost ASIO)]`

- **Input/Output**: Boost ASIO for async TCP/UDP sockets (e.g., port 8081 for orders, pub/sub for updates). Use protocol buffers for serialized messages (e.g., Order {id, eventId, side (yes/no), quantity, price, timestamp}).
- **Threading Model**: One acceptor thread for incoming connections, multiple worker threads (pinned to NUMA nodes) for processing. Use std::thread with affinity masks for NUMA optimization.
- **Data Flow**: Order arrives → Validate → Insert into order book → Match if possible → Execute and log → Broadcast update.

## Core Components and Modules

1. **Socket Handler (Boost ASIO)**:
    - Asynchronous acceptor for incoming orders from Java backend.
    - Features: Connection pooling, error handling (e.g., reconnect on disconnect), and message deserialization.
    - NUMA: Bind to a specific node for I/O-bound tasks.
    - Example: Use **`boost::asio::io_context`** with **`async_accept`** for non-blocking I/O.
2. **Order Book Data Structure**:
    - Dual-sided structure: Separate books for "yes" (bids) and "no" (asks).
    - Implementation: Red-black tree (std::set or Boost Intrusive) for price levels, with FIFO queues (std::deque) per price for time priority. Track best bid/ask for quick access.
    - Operations: Add (O(log M) for new price, O(1) otherwise), Cancel/Modify (O(1)), Match (O(1) for top-of-book).
    - NUMA: Allocate memory from node-local pools to avoid cross-socket access.
3. **Matching Engine (Multithreaded)**:
    - Price-time priority: Match highest bid with lowest ask; execute partial/full fills.
    - Chaos Mode: Dedicated thread injects random volatility (e.g., price adjustments via simple RNG or ML model), triggering re-matches.
    - Threading: Worker pool (e.g., 4-8 threads) processes orders from a lock-free queue (Boost Lockfree). Pin threads to NUMA nodes for locality.
    - Example Flow: Lock order book (std::mutex), check matches, update volumes, unlock.
4. **Event Resolution Module**:
    - Timer-based (Boost ASIO deadline_timer) to resolve events at end-time.
    - Payout: Calculate wins/losses based on outcome, update coin balances via callback to Java backend.
5. **Logging and Persistence**:
    - Async queue for trade logs (e.g., to file or MongoDB via Java API).
    - Features: Timestamped entries with microsecond precision.
6. **Monitoring and Fault Tolerance**:
    - Metrics: Prometheus exporter for latency/throughput.
    - Recovery: Signal handling (SIGINT) for graceful shutdown; checkpoint order book periodically.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **C++ Best Practices**: Use RAII for resource management, avoid dynamic allocations in hot paths, profile with perf/valgrind.
- **NUMA Optimizations**: Use **`numa_alloc_onnode`** for memory, **`sched_setaffinity`** for threads; minimize remote accesses.
- **Performance Tuning**: Kernel bypass (e.g., DPDK if needed) for sockets; test with latency histograms.
- **Integration with Java**: Expose a simple protocol over sockets (e.g., submitOrder, getStatus); use JNI if tighter coupling is required.

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

- **Concurrency Conflicts**: Use fine-grained locking or lock-free structures.
- **High Load**: Scale workers dynamically; add rate limiting.
- **Testing**: Unit tests for matching logic (Catch2); stress tests with simulated order floods.

This blueprint ensures a robust, low-latency engine that complements your Java full stack. Start with the order book and socket setup in Week 1, then add multithreading. If you need code snippets or a low-level design, provide more details!
